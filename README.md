## Building
`*build.sh` - scripts for [automating](https://github.com/clearfraction/ffmpeg/blob/master/.travis.yml) building process

* `scratch-build.sh` - deploy packages to testing/experimental [repository](https://gitlab.com/clearfraction/scratch-repository)
* `build.sh` - deploy packages to stable [repository](https://gitlab.com/clearfraction/repository), highly recommend to use if package is 100% working
* `test_build.sh` - alternative version for test/build, in development stage.
